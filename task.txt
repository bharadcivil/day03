You can compare two JSON objects with the same properties without considering the order of the properties by 
first converting them to strings and then comparing the strings. 
In this code, we first use JSON.stringify() to convert both obj1 and obj2 into JSON strings. Then, we compare the JSON
 strings for equality. This comparison ensures that the objects are considered equal regardless of the property order.
 In my example, obj1 and obj2 will be considered equal because the order of properties doesn't matter in this comparison.
